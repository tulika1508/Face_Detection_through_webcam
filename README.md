# Face_Detection_through_webcam
It is a project to detect faces by drawing rectangle around each face by capturing video from webcam.

The faces are detected through the webcam by creating rectangles around each face.

It uses conversion to gray scale and hence detecting the faces.

It works even when we move our face up,down,left and right.
